# hello there and welcome to my Zerto Assignment!


## my name is Rina Karnauch, a 3rd year student in The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem.

## This is a CRUD operation manging site.

A disclaimer: the assignment is not fully done. 
The functions are not all appearing (the buttons and visuals are there, 
but clicking on them does not change the data in the json), but i wanted to 
make the platform to be seen visually before making the "backend" operations.

Thanks for the opportunity, and have a nice day!

Rina
